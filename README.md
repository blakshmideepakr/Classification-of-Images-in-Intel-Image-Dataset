# <p align="justify"> 
# Performed a multi-classification analysis to recognise and classify the images from the Intel Image Dataset, which contains different images of buildings, forests, streets, etc. Designed and implemented multiple Convolutional Neural Network architectures using Keras, incorporating various activation functions and types of layers and adjusting their parameters to achieve a final accuracy of 93%.
